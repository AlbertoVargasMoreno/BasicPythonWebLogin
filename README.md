# Simple Login Page with Python

## Overview
A basic Python web application demonstrating a simple login page. The project uses standard Python libraries for HTTP server functionality and connects to a PostgreSQL database for user authentication.

## Features
* User Authentication: Verify user credentials against a PostgreSQL database.
* Minimalistic Login Page: Provides a straightforward interface for user login.
* Modular Architecture: Organized into separate files for improved code structure.
* Easy Deployment: Designed for straightforward deployment on various hosting platforms.

## Technologies Used
* Python: The primary programming language.
* HTTP Server: Utilizes Python's built-in http.server module.
* PostgreSQL: Database management system for user authentication.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/AlbertoVargasMoreno/BasicPythonWebLogin.git
2. Install dependencies (I think there's no need to install anything else).
3. Configure the PostgreSQL database.
4. Run the application: python login_controller.py
5. Access the login page at http://localhost:8000.

## Deployment
For deployment on a public server, until now it has not been deployed in a public server.
